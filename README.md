# Challenges
Devin
-
- I tried to do everything in the command line in the beginning, which lead to unnecessary confusion. 
- My machines git was attached to a seperate email, so my commit is shown from my personal account, not my school account. I had to do git config to update it

David
-
-  Creating SSH key was a challenge because I had never set one up before. Once the key was created, the creation of the files and commiting was simplier. 

## Janeth

-  I recieved errors when I tried to create my SSH key. I overcame the challenges that came with SSH key creation process by working with my teammates to resolve the issues since they already created their SSH keys before me.
